     Wiki software has historically provided little support for any form of
     organizational structure. Even given the assumption that the majority of wiki
     users have previous experience with file system-like hierarchies, most wiki
     systems keep things simple (as is the wiki way) and employ a flat page structure.
     As a wiki grows beyond a few dozen pages, some form of organization becomes
     increasingly necessary. This has typically been accomplished by adding
     “category links” to each page, essentially
     <em data-docudipity-id="e81" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">ad hoc</em> terms from an unstructured and
     uncontrolled vocabulary. Because these terms are themselves
     often undefined it can be difficult to ascertain the reason why a given page
     belongs to a category. Even when this is done carefully, as the number of terms
     in the categorization grows a classification scheme for the terms themselves
     likewise becomes increasingly necessary.</p>
     <p id="idp1983099656" data-docudipity-id="e12" data-docudipity-pattern="block">This paper describes problems with existing wiki and “semantic
     wiki” categorization schemes and outlines an approach to information
     organization that avoids the pitfalls of computer-based ontologies by instead
     looking to library science for solutions. It describes the design and
     implementation of a wiki system permitting user-authored
     <em data-docudipity-id="e82" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">assertions</em>, which are dynamically harvested to
     create a Topic Map graph mirroring the explicit structure of the wiki and providing
     it with an underlying classification system.

    As with any document collection, as a wiki grows its need for some form of organization increases
    proportionately. It's not uncommon for wikis to have hundreds or even thousands of pages, without
    even considering the rather atypical Wikipedia (which as of July 2008 claims “approximately
    ten million articles in 253 languages”). Yet Wikipedia has no explicit classification scheme.

    usually camel-case prefixing a category name with the word "Category" (e.g.,
    “CategoryHomePage”, “CategoryDiscussion”, etc.). Any wiki page containing such a
    link is considered categorized under that category. There a number of problems with such a system. First,
    any wiki page containing a given link is categorized accordingly even if that was not the intention of
    the link author, as the mere presence of a link – not its traversal – establishes the categorization.
    Another is that as the categorization of a given wiki page must be expressed on the page itself, there is no
    way to categorize a collection of pages from a different page, via a list or other external structure. The
    categorization naming scheme is also bound to the link names; there are no synonyms, homographs, equivalent
    terms; no way of characterizing the relations between terms, no thesaurus-like hierarchy, indeed, no explicit
    structure at all. One can add or remove categories from a page, but to change the categorization of a page one
    must change its name, which breaks existing links, and there is no facility for synthetic or combinatory categories
    apart from creating longer and more complicated wiki page names. It is a simple system and works reasonably well
    for small document sets.

    likewise “common sense reasoning” relies on mistaken notions of a “common sense” and

    This chapter looks at the semantic treatment needed to transform a natural language into a
    subject language. […] a subject language is based on a natural language but differs from
    it primarily in the semantic structures it uses to normalize vocabulary by setting up a
    one-to-one relationship between terms and their referents. The referential semantics of a
    subject language deals with the generalized homonym problem. It consists of methods for
    restricting term referents so that any given term has one and only one meaning. The relational
    semantics of a subject language deals with the generalized synonym problem and consists of
    methods for linking terms within similar or related meanings.

    If we consider each page on a wiki as the community's “canonical” information about a
    given subject, with its unique page title serving as a descriptor of that subject, the set of page
    titles taken as a whole comprises the subject language of the wiki. The wiki page name and its associated
    URL act as unambiguous subject identifiers; each use of a term is also a link to its reference documentation.

    The extensional meaning of a term in a subject language does not refer to the class of all entities denoted by
    the term but to the class of documents that the term denotes. From an inferential role semantics point of view,
    the evolutionary development of a classification structure based on user design and behavior would (assuming
    active usage) tend towards validating those terms and relations between terms within the classification system
    that are frequently traversed, with infrequently or unused assertional links potentially deprecated or at least
    called into question. This warrants further investigation.

    One of the problems in classification schemes is due to the multireferentiality of words. Briefly,
    <em data-docudipity-id="e480" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">homographs</em> are words that are spelled the same but have different meanings.
    <em data-docudipity-id="e481" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">Polysemes</em> are words that are spelled the same, have different meanings, but
    their meanings are related. These constitute only two of a variety of what are called
    <em data-docudipity-id="e482" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">multireferential</em> words. Even words that aren't usually considered
    multireferential may be interpreted with subtly different meanings when used in different contexts, domains of
    discourse, in different grammatical constructions, or by different people or groups of people (e.g., children
    vs. adults).
    </p><p id="idp2024922008" data-docudipity-id="e179" data-docudipity-pattern="block">
    Library classification systems have dealt with the issue of multireferential terms in various ways. Svenonius
    notes that this can be accomplished either semantically, via domain specification, qualifiers and/or annotations,
    or syntactically (<a class="xlink" href="#Svenonius2000" id="idp2024924568" data-docudipity-id="e483" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">

    The latter, called <em data-docudipity-id="e484" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">nonsemantic disambiguation,</em> is a natural solution for wikis

    Over the years wiki communities have discussed at length and less frequently experimented with the use of namespaces,
    similar to the use of colonized tokens in XML. There are a variety of problems with this, such as the incompatibility
    between various characters as delimiters and URLs, but even with a functional syntax the biggest deterrent is likely
    to be the additional complexity for the user.

    including the very human problem of an inability to see into the future. The flexibility of allowing classifications
    to evolve without breaking is extremely important, especially during the early stages, where categories are still
    relatively unformed. Notably, this problem plagued expert systems implementations, where later changes to root level
    concepts were very difficult to accomplish (e.g., a change of logical foundations, such as from first order to modal
    logic).

    Many of the refinements in the system have been in the approach to defining the interrelationships between terms.
    There are two fundamental Faceted Classification relationship types: semantic and syntactic.

    A <em data-docudipity-id="e494" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">semantic</em> relationship is independent of context and is by definition a permanent
    relationship, arising from the subjects involved. Semantic relationships are further divided into three types:
    <em data-docudipity-id="e495" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">equivalence</em> relationships, where terms are synonyms (and would be cross-referenced
    under the same category); two types of <em data-docudipity-id="e496" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">hierarchical</em> relationships,
    <em data-docudipity-id="e497" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">superclass-subclass</em> and <em data-docudipity-id="e498" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">mereological</em> (whole-part);
    and <em data-docudipity-id="e499" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">affinitive/associative</em> relationships, which are domain-specific relationships
    such as cause and effect, coordination, sequence, genetic, etc.

    denoting otherwise unrelated concepts brought together as a composite subject in a specific context. This is the
    equivalent of how terms would appear together in a common sentence. It operates similarly to how we use keyword
    searches on the Web, such as “biblical archaeology”, “poetry by 12th century Japanese authors”,
    or “medieval weapon manufacture”. This approach is at the heart of the resource organization approach taken
    by most wikis in their use of camel-cased wiki page names. In the Assertion Framework we didn't set out to avoid
    the use of wiki page names as subject identifiers, but were looking to supplant the klunky use of category names by
    use of typed assertions between pages.

    or whitespace-delimited list of tokens. Whereas on these sites users are generally permitted to add tags to a
    resource at will (absent any validation or even spell-checking), in our case this would mean that many or most tags

    While Faceted Classification permits synthetic classification, its facets are still usually derived from a controlled
    vocabulary. If each tag were represented by a wiki page, where each definition is discoverable, tags could then be seen
    as facets. The decision was therefore made to require each tag to be represented by a wiki page, even if this may be
    seen by some users as onerous. We don't yet have feedback that would permit us to evaluate how this may affect
    the willingness of people to tag resources.

    the “Generic Relation” (ostensibly, superclass-subclass) and
    “Instance” (class-instance) relations. We provide the two Z39.19 generic

    While the expression language and the functional implementation of the

    Ceryle Project and/or its current wiki implementation, in abstraction most
    elements of this design could be reused in non-wiki applications.

    One aspect of Ceryle that was clear early on was that in addition to supporting
    the stated functional requirements it also needed to serve as its own development
    laboratory. Over the years there have been a large number of experiments with
    features, software libraries, conversion tools, visualization capabilities, some
    of which have survived, though many only in backup archives. As a framework it has
    gradually matured and now includes user scripting and various extensibility features.
    The Assertion Framework described in this paper is a module added to the embedded
    wiki functioning within the Ceryle standalone application, but has also been installed
    as part of a generic JSPWiki distribution running on Apache Tomcat; in the latter case
    there are no dependencies on the standalone Ceryle application.

    There were two primary requirements that led to the addition of a wiki:  the ability
    to provide simple formatting markup in a non-WYSIWYG text editor; and to provide an online
    and/or collaborative editing environment that could function in either a standalone (local)
    or online environment.

    The availability of software libraries, compatibility with the Ceryle application as a
    development environment, and my own previous experience made Java the programming language
    of choice.  An evaluation was made among the offerings of web servers and wiki software,
    based on features, ease of embedding, extensibility, stability, and the health of their
    respective communities and/or sponsors. Jetty<sup class="fn-label" data-docudipity-id="e549" data-docudipity-pattern="inline"><a href="#fn11" class="footnoteref" id="fn11-ref" data-docudipity-id="e741" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">[11]</a></sup>
    was chosen as the embedded web server (there
    was little competition). No modifications to Jetty were needed apart from some configuration
    and embedding code. Following an evaluation of available open source wiki software applications,
    JSPWiki<sup class="fn-label" data-docudipity-id="e550" data-docudipity-pattern="inline"><a href="#fn12" class="footnoteref" id="fn12-ref" data-docudipity-id="e742" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">[12]</a></sup>
    was chosen as the most versatile and extensible for our purposes. In the past year
    JSPWiki has been selected by the Apache Foundation as its wiki solution.

    The initial content for the present implementation was derived from the Māori Subject Headings
    and Iwi Hapū Names List thesaurus (Z39.19-compliant) databases and converted via Groovy scripts
    into interim XHTML documents, which were then converted into Linear Topic Map (LTM) source files
    to provide a backing structure for the wiki as well as generating an individual wiki page for
    each record.

    Initially, the database export was only available as a plain text format. The MSH database software
    has been recently upgraded and now supports an XML export, so the Groovy script was updated to
    process the new format. This could have been accomplished via XSLT but the existing investment
    and rapid development of the scripting solution was considered important.

    While JSPWiki was considered a good foundation, earlier versions of JSPWiki did not include any
    event handling code, so a general purpose WikiEvents API, a number of WikiEvent classes and a
    WikiEventManager (see Figure 4. WikiEventManager)
    were developed for this project. This permitted application-level events to be fired as wiki
    pages were created, edited, renamed, deleted, and displayed. This general purpose wiki events
    API and implementation are now part of the Apache JSPWiki distribution.
    </p><p id="idp2024993080" data-docudipity-id="e246" data-docudipity-pattern="block">
    Each wiki page editing session fires a number of associated WikiEvents. By filtering on event

    Given that the basic idea was to permit users to make Assertions, we needed a means of
    expressing them using a simple wiki-like syntax. JSPWiki has a number of extensibility
    features, the WikiPlugin API being the most suitable for developing syntax-level functionality.
    </p><p id="idp2024995000" data-docudipity-id="e249" data-docudipity-pattern="block">
    JSPWiki augments its formatting and linking syntax with a plugin syntax, where a reference
    to the plugin name is followed by a plugin body, which may contain one or more named parameters.
    For example, to transclude the wiki page “CopyrightStatement” using the InsertPage
    plugin one would include the following wiki text:
    </p><pre class="programlisting" id="idp2024998200" data-docudipity-id="e250" data-docudipity-pattern="block"><code data-docudipity-id="e553" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">[{InsertPage page='CopyrightStatement'}]</code></pre><p id="idp2024996024" data-docudipity-id="e251" data-docudipity-pattern="block">
    When the WikiEngine encounters this plugin syntax it instantiates a plugin object based on the plugin's name as mapped
    to a Java class name. The plugin object's  method is called and the plugin then performs its programmed tasks.
    </p><p id="idp2024996152" data-docudipity-id="e252" data-docudipity-pattern="block">
    From the user's perspective, our entire system is implemented via a set of custom plugins, as described below. We've
    therefore augmented the default JSPWiki wiki text syntax with an additional assertion-related vocabulary, this vocabulary
    in keeping with the rest of JSPWiki's plugin syntax. Users already familiar with other JSPWiki plugins would find nothing
    unusual using the syntax of these new assertion features, and in fact, some of the plugins simplify the JSPWiki plugin
    syntax by not requiring use of explicit parameters.

    This uses a TagManager that functions independently of the Assertion Framework, so that JSPWiki installations

    When an instance of an AssertionPlugin is parsed on a wiki page it fires a subclass of
    WikiEvent called an AssertionEvent. An event listener filtering for AssertionEvents passes this on
    to a parser which generates an Assertion object corresponding to the parameters of the plugin
    syntax. In addition to Subject, Predicate, and Object we also capture the name of its origin wiki
    page and a creation timestamp<sup class="fn-label" data-docudipity-id="e568" data-docudipity-pattern="inline"><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteref" id="fn14-ref" data-docudipity-id="e756" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">[14]</a></sup>.

    The system supporting the expression, generation, caching and querying of Assertion objects
    is called an <em data-docudipity-id="e571" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">Assertion Framework</em>
    (see <a class="xref" href="#fig05" data-docudipity-id="e572" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">Figure 5</a>),
    which can be thought of in both static and dynamic terms:  static in the sense that at any point in
    time a snapshot of the system provides the set of extant Assertions; dynamic in the sense that the
    system is mutable, continually changing as people create and modify the wiki pages.
    </p><p id="idp2025829432" data-docudipity-id="e281" data-docudipity-pattern="block">
    The workhorse of the system is the AssertionHandler, which handles all incoming Assertion objects,
    and managing a cache containing the set of all Assertions on the wiki. The initial set of Assertions
    is generated by an AssertionCrawler scan of all pages.
    </p><p id="idp2025828152" data-docudipity-id="e282" data-docudipity-pattern="block">

    In the current implementation, the life of the AssertionHandler is very short. While the Assertion
    Framework using an AssertionHandler is a functional system, our requirements are better met by
    queries from a Topic Map.
    </p><p id="idp2025826488" data-docudipity-id="e286" data-docudipity-pattern="block">
    Following initialization of the WikiEngine on startup, the AssertionCrawler crawls the wiki pages.
    Once this has finished it fires a completion event which triggers creation of a
    <em data-docudipity-id="e575" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">WikiMapManager</em>
    (see <a class="xref" href="#fig06" data-docudipity-id="e576" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">Figure 6</a>),
    which also implements the AssertionHandler API.
    </p><p id="idp2025831352" data-docudipity-id="e287" data-docudipity-pattern="block">
    The WikiMapManager obtains the set of Assertion objects from the existing AssertionHandler and
    converts them into Topics and Associations in an in-memory TopicMap object using the TM4J Topic Map engine.
    </p><p id="idp2025833528" data-docudipity-id="e288" data-docudipity-pattern="block">
    Given our model of Assertions as simple binary relations, the translation to a Topic Map is straightforward.
    As described previously, the Assertion object contains references to the wiki page names for Subject,
    Predicate, and Object, the origin wiki page and a creation timestamp. Each wiki page name reference is
    converted to a Topic whose base name matches the wiki page name, with the page URL as a subject identifier.
    The Predicate is further typed as some descendant class of Relation within the Topic Map's subsumption
    hierarchy for relations. The Assertion itself is converted to a Topic Map Association, typed by the
    Predicate's Topic and also reified as a Topic. The timestamp is added as a property to this Association.
    If any of the wiki page name references match an existing Topic name the existing Topic is used. We are not
    currently scoping page names but will likely add scope to all names in the future given the current
    development project is multilingual.
    </p><p id="idp2025831480" data-docudipity-id="e289" data-docudipity-pattern="block">
    Once this conversion is complete the WikiMapManager usurps the functioning of the existing AssertionHandler
    (which is then destroyed), so that incoming AssertionEvents are now processed as modifications and queries
    on the Topic Map.
    </p><p id="idp2025831992" data-docudipity-id="e290" data-docudipity-pattern="block">
    The author of an Assertion relies upon the ability to read the respective wiki page documentation related
    to the sentence components at the moment of its expression. Since the system is mutable it must also be
    possible to view a snapshot of the system at the moment when the expression was made in order for others to
    interpret the Assertion correctly.

    The TopicMapPlugin is currently used to perform diagnostic queries on the Topic Map from a wiki page. The result
    of a query via a wiki plugin can return an XHTML fragment or content which could be processed via a Java Applet,
    so this usage is limited to direct display or visualization features.
    </p><p id="idp2025831864" data-docudipity-id="e293" data-docudipity-pattern="block">
    There have been a few Web service experiments that return Topic Map (XTM) fragments, e.g., Topic and Association
    serializations corresponding to a set of Assertion objects. Though an interesting feature, there is no specific
    application requirement for inter-wiki sharing of structures that can't currently be accomplished via the
    existing XML-RPC features, so this remains as yet undeveloped.

    Note that “Inferencer” is shown as a small box in the diagram. This is to indicate that this is
    not some big fancy inference engine, just a single Java class that performs simple queries on the Topic Map,
    such as returning simple transitive inferences upon relations whose predicates have been marked as transitive,
    such as ancestor and descendant tests, plus a few utility methods. Most return a boolean value so that they can
    be chained. As this functionality can easily be accommodated within the current use of wiki plugins no additional
    interfaces have been developed.

    One of the features of the system is the ability to provide run-time augmentation with the addition of drop-in
    LTM files as Topic Map modules. For example, if a user creates a wiki page called “Portugal” and
    asserts that Portugal IsA Country, we look up the
    page name in the ISO 3166 Country Codes for Topic Maps, as well as making any additional assertions about that
    Topic based on any Associations in the Topic Map.

    Modules available, in development, or planned include ontologies for languages and countries, places, place
    names, events, geocode, measurement and datatypes, mappings to other library subject headings, and various other
    subject domains. One idea in the works incorporates a place names to latitude-longitude database to permit
    inclusion of Google Maps. For example, any wiki page asserted as a place would look up its wiki page name in
    the place names database, then use a wiki plugin to insert a Google Map for that location. This remains an area
    ripe for further exploration, and will likely be determined in part by user feedback.

    their Topics are scoped accordingly so that we may in the future extract Topic Maps corresponding to their
    respective domains.

    With all of this additional machinery behind the scenes, what effect does this have on the user experience?
    It must be said that, to reiterate one of the requirements, there is little desire to expose a great deal of
    complexity, particularly for readers. We likewise have on occasion decided not to implement a feature when it
    was seen to significantly add to the complexity of either the browsing or editing experience. Thus, most of
    the Assertion Framework features are experienced as links, structure displays or improved search or navigation.
    For example, the generated output from an AssertionPlugin shows the Subject, Predicate and Object as active
    wiki page links. A hideable navigational panel has been added to the page footer that displays any assertions
    or other information queried from the Topic Map for that wiki page.
    </p><p id="idp2025837752" data-docudipity-id="e302" data-docudipity-pattern="block">

    public release of the service.

    The Assertion Framework is still in a prototype state so there are many questions as to the viability of both

    This paper has put a substantial focus on epistemological and design issues rather than on implementation details.

    – any programmer could accomplish that – but in the investigation into what the use of this
    <em data-docudipity-id="e320" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">means</em>, i.e., does the expression of declarative statements incur an entailment
    or not? And if so, of what order? Surely there is no single answer to this question, but in the same way as people
    commonly anthropomorphize machines (hell, we anthropomorphize <em data-docudipity-id="e321" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">rocks</em>), this paper
    is, if anything, meant to inject a note of caution into inferring that the systems we develop do more than they do,
    that our claims notwithstanding we are in large part still playing with toys.

      We define <em data-docudipity-id="e618" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">category</em> as an ad hoc division within a subject domain
      absent an explicit classification scheme. Whereas classification may be said to be systematic,
      categorization need not be. Categorization is a preliminary process in the creation of a classification
      scheme but in informal or colloquial systems may be the only process. In library science a category is
      sometimes considered synonymous with a <em data-docudipity-id="e619" data-docudipity-pattern="inline">facet</em> (from Faceted Classification).

      It seems that few researchers and/or developers understand RDF Semantics much less
      follow it in practice, given that the majority of projects I've reviewed bear little relation to the RDF
      model theory, either in definition or stated references. Indeed, many seem to be in direct conflict with
      one or more RDF axioms or have extended it in ways contradictory to the model theory (e.g., reference to
      non-FOL logics, non-monotonicity). I've long thought that the buzz over RDF is simply a misplaced
      enthusiasm for basic graph theory.
